# JORDAN
"JORDAN" is a beautiful acryonym created by the one and only Jordan, standing for *Just Observing Robots Doing Absolutely Nothing*.

It existed last year, but with the new game we gotta remake it.

# Whyyyyyyy

Excluding the obvious reason of not wanting to do scouting on paper, there are two reasons why this exists:

- I wanted to learn dart (otherwise known as i *hate* react native)

- We only made the scouting app for this year in swift/swiftUI. It was a pretty dumb.

- *did i mention that i hate react native?*

# I dont understand you
