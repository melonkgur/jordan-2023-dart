# JORDAN
"JORDAN" is a beautiful acryonym created by the one and only Jordan, standing for "*Just Observing Robots Doing Absolutely Nothing"*.

Last year we made the first ever JORDAN, and now its time to make another.

# Whyyyyyyy

Excluding the obvious reason of not wanting to do scouting on paper, there are two reasons why this exists:

- I wanted to learn dart (otherwise known as i *hate* react native)

- We only made the scouting app for this year in swiftUI, meaning no android *(visible [here](https://github.com/Jbay33/JORDAN-Charged-Up))*

- *did i mention that i hate react native?*

*UPDATE: i have just been informed that we are no longer using the ios exclusive version. cry about it*

# I dont understand you

good
